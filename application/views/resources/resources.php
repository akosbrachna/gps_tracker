    The web application can be downloaded from
    <a href="https://github.com/akosbrachna/gps_tracker/" target="_blank">github</a>. 
    It can be modified and used freely. There are simple instructions on the installation steps 
    if one wishes to run the website on one's own server.
    <br/><br/>
    An android application is being under development too. That project will also be shared on github and 
    the apk will be available here. The android application as a foreground service can continuously and 
    seamlessly be sending the gps location from the phone to the server.
